An arduino based simple synth and sequencer.

# before start
This is a very simple arduino based wavetable synth with control and sequence functions. I made it with Arduino Nano. I am not an expert coder. If you find the code a little dodgy, feel free to make it transparent. Originally I made this stuff for my own usage. Later I would like to update the code with comments and attach the schematic.

# start
Copy the files into a folder. Download and copy the 3rd party sources (the_synth, QuickStats, LiquidCrystal) to the folder as well. Open the sequencer.ino with the IDE. Try to compile the project. If you get errors double-check the included libraries and the path.
